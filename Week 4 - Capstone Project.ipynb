It also means that this location is either a famous tourist hub or a major commercial hub. Annual enplanments information of Top 30 US Airports is avaiable on Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States).

    "**GDP Information** : Logically within the cities which host top 30 airports, cities who have higher GDPs a probably the business hot spots and a preferred travel destination for many. Therefore, GDP information of the cities which host top 30 airports can give even more insights and facilitate in our decision making. GDP data is also avaiable of Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._metropolitan_areas_by_GDP). This data will be scraped and matched with the annaul enplanments data. <br> <br>\n",
    "**Hotels Around Airport** : This is another indicator of high traveller through a certain city. Data regarding number of hotels/motels/resorts within 10 miles of the airport will be fetched through Foursquare API. Following image is a screenshot of the Foursquare API documentation which shows different 'category_ids' belonging to different hotel types. This will come in handy to make intelligent API calls instead of fetching all the venues first then filtering it later<br>\n",
